## Architecture

The project follows a microservices architecture, leveraging the strengths of Go and technologies such as WebSockets and SQLite. Each microservice has a specific responsibility, contributing to the overall functionality of the collaboration platform.

## Microservices

1. **User Service:** Manages user authentication and authorization.
2. **Collaboration Service:** Handles collaborative sessions and real-time synchronization.
3. **WebSocket Service:** Manages WebSocket connections for real-time communication.
4. **Document Service:** Manages the content of collaborative documents, code, or drawings.
5. **Database Service (SQLite):** Stores user data, collaborative session information, and content.

## Technologies

- **Language:** Go
- **Web Framework:** Gin or Echo
- **WebSockets:** Gorilla WebSocket library
- **Database:** SQLite
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes or Docker Compose

## Project Structure

The project is organized into microservices, each residing in its respective directory under the `cmd/` folder. Internal packages in the `internal/` directory contain the logic for user management, collaboration, WebSockets, document handling, and database interactions. Shared libraries are placed in the `pkg/` directory.
